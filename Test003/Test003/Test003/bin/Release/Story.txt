Glamorhobo woke up one day in her totally blinged out cardboard box.
"I am the most galmorus hobo this side of the Rio Grande!"
Glamorhobo summoned a unicorn using the magical unicorn whistle she found in the garbage last week.
Her trusty unicorn Pumpernickel came to her side. 
"Come Pumpernickel! There is adventure to be had!"
Pumpernickel whinnied and a rainbow bridge appeared. The two galloped accross it all the way to little Tokyo.
Glamorhobo saw something flash at her feet.
"What's this?"
THE END
