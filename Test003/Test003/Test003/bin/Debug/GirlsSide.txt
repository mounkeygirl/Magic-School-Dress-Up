Here we go! Mae is other twin the Henry's sister. At school, Henry goes by the name Harrietta as part of disguise.  Mae is talented singer 
and also enjoys the wizard games. She choose to participate in dressup competition where she will be competing with his twin cross-dressed
brother. They decided that both do not need to be on the same team so that Harrietta will not be discovered as a boy in girls' school. Mae's
best friend, Jamie who was not a fun of Henry at all. Henry was as a good student in class and also possessed fine wizard skills. His long 
wavy hair and wizardry spells tend to get him attention he was dying for.Jamie became jealous of Henry's fame. Jamie was from a wealthy 
family, pretty, has many clothes. In her mind she should be the center of attention. Mae knowing that her best friend Jamie was not pleased
with Harrietta being famous and like by every tried to warn him about it but fell on deaf ears. Jamie does not know that Harrietta  is a 
boy who is cross-dressed to get education for free and is Mae's twin. Jamie decided to confront Harrietta about her famousness and also to 
warn her that she does not tone it down she will burn down the cateteria and blame her for it. Harrietta was terrified of Jamie's intentions 
and she could not afford to ignore it. Harrietta decided invite Jamie to be a a team for yearly dress-up festivals. Without hesistion Jamie
agreed. Since she is from a well off family she will provide clothings for competition. The competition festival is competitive. This means
the competitors have to time practicig together alot. Mae singing talent was also becoming noticeable to some degree but not as much as 
harrietta's spells. Mae was not happy that her talent was being overshadowed by Harriette's and to make things worse was that her best 
friend is now teaming up with him. Jamie was also becoming noticeable due to her being in a team with the famous wizard in entire school. 
As Jamie continued to spend time with Harriette she become interested in her and wanted their team work be taken to another level. Jamie 
invited her and Mae to go swimming one of the weekends. Harriette declined the invitation to avoid blowing up his cover. Mae was excited to
go swimming. Jamie was not taking no for answer for Harriette not going to swimming. Well harriette gave an excuse that she didnt have a 
swimming custome and that she is does not know how to swim. Jamie was quick to buy her swimming customs and offer to train her how to swim.
Harriette tried to come up with excuses but to avail. She finally agreed to go swimming under the condition that she will not swim rather 
spectate.  Jamie relactantly agreed, but also had a condition that provided that they take a picture together in bikinis. That did not sound
well to Harriette at all. Instead she decided to tell jamie about his reason for disguise.
Jamie was upset after finding out the real identity of Harriette and had to make decisions whether to continue as team for competition or to 
saboatage the situation which will lead to Harriette being expelled. If Jamie decides to keep being teammates there is a good chance that they
will win the competition. This will her more famous as well. If she decides to sabaotage it, changes of winning the competition drops
drastically, loses her best friend. However, might gain headteacher's attention for exposing the unwanted people in school. Decisions decisions!
