<Switch Scenes to Boy Attending School Now>
The boy twin attends the magic school cross-dressing as a girl in order to get in.
He's pumped about the idea of learning magic but this is an all girls' school. If he gets caught he'll be expelled.
He meets a girl who can work as his exposition fiary and tutorial guide.
Girl: "My name is Jane Shields, but you can call me James."
Henry: "I'm Henrietta. Nice to meet you. Uh, James, you said?"
James: "Yeah, I hung out with the guys a lot growing up. It became a game to introduce me with a boy's name and see how long it took people to notice. We did it for so long that using my given name feels weirdly formal."
It's standard practice here to use one's magic to transform verious objects into clothing.
He's challanged very quickly to a fashion contest, and realizes that this is a normal occurance at this school.
The girl who challanges him can be a snobby girl who tries to put him in his place.
